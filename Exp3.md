# Experment - 3:- Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Aim
To capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark for monitoring, troubleshooting, and forensic investigation of network activities.

## Description
Wireshark is a widely-used open-source network protocol analyzer that captures live network data packets and provides detailed inspection and analysis. It helps network administrators and forensic investigators understand network behavior, detect anomalies, identify security issues, and troubleshoot network problems. Capturing network traffic enables deep insights into the data exchanged between devices on a network.

## Tools and Equipment Used
- **Wireshark Software**: Open-source network traffic capture and analysis tool.

- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: The hardware on the computer that connects to the network for capturing traffic.

- **Computer/Workstation**: Device with Wireshark installed connected to the target network.

- **Network Connection**: Wired or wireless network to be monitored.

- **Optional - Network Tap or Port Mirroring**: Devices or configurations for passive capturing of all network traffic if required.




## Procedure
1. **Install Wireshark**: Download and install Wireshark on the network analysis workstation.

7. **Stop Capture**: Click the “Stop” button to end the capture session.
8. **Analyze Packets**:
   - Use filters to isolate specific traffic (e.g., IP addresses, protocols).
   - Inspect packet details, headers, and payload data.
   - Identify suspicious behavior, errors, or performance issues.

9. **Save Capture File**: Save the captured data in a .pcap file for further analysis or documentation.
10. **Report Findings**: Document significant observations including timestamps, IP addresses, protocols, and anomalies detected.

## Result
A detailed capture of network traffic is obtained and saved successfully. Analysis using Wireshark reveals useful insights into network communication, potential security issues, or operational problems. The data can be used for troubleshooting, forensic investigation, or network optimization.
